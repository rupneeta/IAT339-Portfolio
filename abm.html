              <p class="about-me-info-text"> Applied Biological Materials is a biotech company that I had the please to work for over the summer as a Coop intern. As a member of their design team, I was introduced to working both individually and on a small design team. Through my coop, I learnt many valuable skills and gained experience with creating and pitching designs to the managerial team.</p>

            <p class="about-me-info-text">Working in a scientific field proved to have its challenges as all of the work that was required to be completed, relied on my ability to understand and work with new concepts. This then made me adapt my design process in order to add in time for undestanding the scientific background behind the designs I was making. One for instance was the weekly e-flyers I was to create based off of promotions the company was having. </p>
            <p class="about-me-info-text">
            My workflow for creating e-fylers was based off of initially researching the protocol that was being advertised, run my understanding of the concept by my supervisor, and then to start brainstorming graphical ideas. My main concern was to make the designs easily understandable by those both in and outside of the field. </p>
            <p class="about-me-info-text">
            Brainstorming the graphics was something that took time as I had to cater to two different audiences. One that was already aquainted with the technology that was being promoted, and one that wasn't. This then forced me to think of the concepts in a larger and more abstract sense, yet not too abstract that it would take away from the scientific reasoning. I began to think of each concept as an analogy, and how I would go about explaining the technology to someone without a science background, like myself.</p>
            <p class="about-me-info-text">
            After coming up with different analogies for the technology, I would then sketch out my ideas and run them by my supervisor. After deliberating, we would pick the design that made the most sense to both audiences, and then I would create the works in Illustrator.</p>
