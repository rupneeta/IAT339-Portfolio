During my term, I was exposed to the working ways of a corporate company, while still being a part of a smaller team. Much of my work was done individually, but I was to report my work back to my supervisors, and then to the project management team. In addition to working with my design team, I was also paired to work with project management and the developer teams. By being exposed to different working groups, I was able to hone my skills to be able to communicate my designs to differing colleagues.</p>
